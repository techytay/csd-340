        <h1>Assignment 2.3 – Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1: The Basics</h2>
        <p class="intro">My name is Taylor Niemann. I am from Lincoln, NE. I currently live in
            Lincoln, but I have plans to a larger city within the next year. My 
            goal is to move to either Omaha, NE or Dallas, TX.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite hobbies is growing a home garden with vegetables
            and fruits. I can usually grow my garden from early May to late
            October in Nebraska. A warmer climate such as Dallas, TX would allow
            me to have a longer growing season.</p>
        <p>I have an older brother, an older sister, and a twin sister. My
            brother lives in Denver, CO. My two sisters as well as my parents live
            in Lincoln, NE. If I were to move to Texas, I would be moving away
            from all of my family.</p>
        <p>I am enjoying learning software development and looking forward to a
            career in the field. <span class="sentence">A career change will offer a good opportunity
            for change and starting a new chapter in a different city.</span> I am
            thankful that I am able to make a career change and make my dreams happen.</p>
